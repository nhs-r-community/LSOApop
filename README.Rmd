The goal of `LSOApop` is to make population estimates for **Lower layer Super Output Areas (LSOA)** and their **Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)** easily available in R.
Population estimates are broken down by age (0 to 90+) and gender (female/male).
Information about the original sources of the data and a transparent description of all transformation of the data that is made available in this package can be found in this repository, see `"data-raw/imd.R` and `"data-raw/lsoa.R`.
Main changes to the original data structures include (1) the transformation from wide to long data, (2) the addition of further information that was only available in variable names, and (3) renaming variables in a consistent way.

The current version of this package only includes LSOA population estimates and IMD scores for the year 2019 for England.
Because we store quite a lot in this package it currently relatively large (~9mb) compared to other packages.

## Installation

You can install the current version of `LSOApop` from [GitHub](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/LSOApop) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nhs-r-community/LSOApop")
```

## Example

```{r}
# Load the package
library(LSOApop)
```

### Lower layer Super Output Areas (LSOA)

The LSOA population estimates are available in the dataset `lsoa`:

```{r}
# Show the first 6 rows of the dataset
# For further information about this dataset see the help file: help(lsoa)
head(lsoa)
```

### Indicies of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)

The IMD scores (raw scores and ranked deciles) and available in the dataset `imd`:

```{r}
# Show the first 6 rows of the dataset
# For further information about this dataset see the help file: help(imd)
head(imd)
```
